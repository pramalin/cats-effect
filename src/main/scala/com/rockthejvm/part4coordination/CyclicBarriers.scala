    A cyclic barrier is a coordination primitive that
    - is initialized with a count
    - has a single API: await

    A cyclic barrier will (semantically) block all the fibers calling its await() method untill we have exactly N fibers waiting
      at which point the barrier will unblock all fibers and reset to ints original state.
    Any further fiber will again block until we have exactly N fibers waiting.
    ...
    And so on.
